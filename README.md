# My-first-game-I-made-when-I-was-12-years-old
My first game as a 2D platformer game made with Godot Game Engine.

This project is a very special one for me – it’s the first game I ever created as a kid. Inspired by the world of Adventure Time, I built a small 2D platformer using Godot, experimenting with the basics of game development.

The game features simple platforming mechanics like jumping, running, and avoiding obstacles, all wrapped in a playful, nostalgic theme. It’s far from a polished or professional game, but it represents the moment I first discovered how fun it is to bring ideas to life through code and creativity.

Looking back, this project reminds me of where my passion for making games started. It’s not just a game, but a piece of my journey into programming and game design.
